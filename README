The entire photo searching implementation is reusable with the PhotoSearch.js file. To use this, a web project just needs the file, then can call it in a view by creating an instance of PhotoSearch, filling in as parameters an input field for the search query, an empty div to fill in with the thumbnail photos, and the url to the action previously implemented in the project that will do the actual searching through the project's database for the photo, provided with the input query from the javascript as the input field in the url.
